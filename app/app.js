angular.module('snowmentum', [])

.controller('MainController', function($scope) {
  
});


/**** 
Something like, store user's local spot in local storage
On load check if there's a spot, if not ask for one
Once one is entered and stashed, remove the input fields
display heady dope visuals (maybe graph similar to msw? definitely wind/swell arrows but keep it tight and speedy)

Also, think of a better way to name forecast it gets confusing
